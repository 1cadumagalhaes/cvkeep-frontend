# What is it?

CV Keep is a `Free and Open Source Platform` intended to manage `Online Resum√©s`. Its free, pretty and simple. The idea is to deal with your resume as an online profile. Instead of send resume files, you send a resume link. Its perfect if you dont want to keep updating things when adding new information on your resume. Its quick and easy to maintain/update.

Once `Keep CV` is free and open source you can host your own plaform (Since you dont use the same brand). This can be very useful if you have a business and need to store your own user profiles, or if you are a job agency that wants a clean and quick CV registration system, or if you need to store people resumes for any purpose, including comercial ones.
